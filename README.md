## Project Title: Term Deposit Subscription Prediction from Telemarketing Calls

**Author:** Uday Bhaskar Voora  
**Course:** Intro to Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model that reliably forecasts whether a bank customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on telemarketing call data. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the model helps optimize marketing campaigns by targeting clients most likely to subscribe, saving resources and improving campaign effectiveness.

---

## Motivation

Direct marketing campaigns often waste resources by contacting clients unlikely to subscribe. This project provides a data-driven approach to predict subscription likelihood, allowing banks to focus efforts strategically and enhance customer experience.

## Dataset

- Source: Portuguese Banking Dataset  
- Data Description: Customer demographics, campaign details, and subscription outcomes.  
- Size: ~45,000 records with various categorical and numerical features.  
- Target variable: `y` (1 if subscribed, 0 otherwise).

---

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- Handled categorical variables using binary, ordinal, and one-hot encoding.
- Scaled numerical features using MinMaxScaler.
- Balanced the dataset using SMOTE oversampling and random undersampling to address class imbalance.

### Model Selection
Evaluated multiple classifiers:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Network
- TabNet (deep learning for tabular data)
- XGBoost
- LightGBM

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Used GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to find optimal parameters for each model.
